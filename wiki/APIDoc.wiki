=Usage =

Call it on a jQuery object created from one element and pass an array of
objects with "tag" and "count" attributes. E.g.:

{{{
var tags = [{tag: "computers", count: 56}, {tag: "mobile" , count :12}, ... ];
$("#tagcloud"}.tagCloud(tags);
}}}

= Configuration =

Optionally you can pass a configuration object to tagCloud as the second
parameter. Allowed settings are:

sort: Comparator function used for sort the tags before displaying, or false if no sorting needed.

   default: sort by tag text using
          function (a, b) {return a.tag < b.tag ? -1 : (a.tag == b.tag ? 0 : 1)

click: Event handler which receives the tag name as first parameter and the original click event as second. The preventDefault() is called on event before passing so don't bother.

   default: you should'nt use the default, but:
          function(tag, event) {alert(tag);return false}


maxFontSizeEm: Size of the largest tag in the cloud in css 'em'. The smallest one's size is 1em so this value is the ratio of the smallest and largest sizes.

   default: 4


= Styling =

 The plugin adds the "tagcloudlink" class to the generated tag links. Note that an "&nbsp;" is generated between the links too.
